Spam Email Classifier

This project implements a Spam Email Classifier using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Spam emails can lead to a waste of time and potential security risks. This project addresses this issue by developing a classifier capable of distinguishing between spam and ham (non-spam) emails.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Place the dataset (e.g., 'spam.csv') in the project directory.
4. Run the `spam_classifier.py` script.
5. View the model evaluation metrics and confusion matrices generated.


## Dataset

The raw email dataset should be in CSV format with columns representing email messages and their corresponding categories (spam or ham).
